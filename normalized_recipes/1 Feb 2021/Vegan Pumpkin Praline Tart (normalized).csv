Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

Make the almond cookie crust:
Place all ingredients for the crust in a food processor and add water a tablespoon at a time until
the mixture comes together.
Dump the almond cookie dough into an 8-inch tart pan and press down with the heel of your hand to
form an even layer. Press the dough up the sides of the pan with your fingers until the entire pan
is covered. Prick the bottom of the crust all over with the tines of a fork and refrigerate until
you make the filling.

Make the filling:
Place all ingredients for the filling in the food processor and process until smooth. Pour into the
tart shell. Use a knife or spatula to spread it evenly.

Make the praline:
Place all ingredients for the praline in the food processor and process until the nuts are chopped
into fairly small pieces. You can stop earlier if you prefer larger pieces of pecans.
Spread the praline evenly over the top of the filling.
Place the tart pan on a cookie sheet and bake 40 minutes or until the top feels firm.
Remove and let cool thoroughly. Chill for an hour before serving.
